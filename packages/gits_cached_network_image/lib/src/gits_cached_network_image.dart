  /// A builder that specifies the widget to display to the user while an image
  /// is still loading.
  ///
  /// If this is null, and the image is loaded incrementally (e.g. over a
  /// network), the user will receive no indication of the progress as the
  /// bytes of the image are loaded.
  ///
  ///
  /// ## Performance implications
  ///
  /// If a [loadingBuilder] is specified for an image, the [Image] widget is
  /// likely to be rebuilt on every
  /// [rendering pipeline frame](rendering/RendererBinding/drawFrame.html) until
  /// the image has loaded. This is useful for cases such as displaying a loading
  /// progress indicator, but for simpler cases such as displaying a placeholder
  /// widget that doesn't depend on the loading progress (e.g. static "loading"
  /// text), [frameBuilder] will likely work and not incur as much cost.
  ///
  /// ## Chaining with [frameBuilder]
  ///
  /// If a [frameBuilder] has _also_ been specified for an image, the two
  /// builders will be chained together: the `child` argument to this
  /// builder will contain the _result_ of the [frameBuilder]. For example,
  /// consider the following builders used in conjunction:
  ///
  /// {@macro flutter.widgets.Image.frameBuilder.chainedBuildersExample}
  ///
  /// {@tool dartpad}
  /// The following sample uses [loadingBuilder] to show a
  /// [CircularProgressIndicator] while an image loads over the network.
  ///
  /// {@end-tool}
  ///
  /// Run against a real-world image on a slow network, the previous example
  /// renders the following loading progress indicator while the image loads
  /// before rendering the completed image.

  /// soon as the first image frame is available (and will appear to "pop" in
  /// if it becomes available asynchronously). Callers might use this builder to
  /// add effects to the image (such as fading the image in when it becomes
  /// available) or to display a placeholder widget while the image is loading.
  ///
  /// To have finer-grained control over the way that an image's loading
  /// progress is communicated to the user, see [loadingBuilder].
  ///
  /// ## Chaining with [loadingBuilder]
  ///
  /// If a [loadingBuilder] has _also_ been specified for an image, the two
  /// builders will be chained together: the _result_ of this builder will
  /// be passed as the `child` argument to the [loadingBuilder]. For example,
  /// consider the following builders used in conjunction:
  ///
  /// {@template flutter.widgets.Image.frameBuilder.chainedBuildersExample}
  /// ```dart
  /// Image(
  ///   image: _image,
  ///   frameBuilder: (BuildContext context, Widget child, int? frame, bool? wasSynchronouslyLoaded) {
  ///     return Padding(
  ///       padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),

  ///   },
  ///   loadingBuilder: (BuildContext context, Widget child, ImageChunkEvent? loadingProgress) {
  ///     return Center(child: child);

  /// The alignment aligns the given position in the image to the given position

  /// middle of the bottom edge of its layout bounds.
  ///
  /// To display a subpart of an image, consider using a [CustomPainter] and

  /// images); and in [TextDirection.rtl] contexts, the image will be drawn with
  /// a scaling factor of -1 in the horizontal direction so that the origin is
  /// in the top right.
  ///
  /// This is occasionally used with images in right-to-left environments, for
  /// images that were designed for left-to-right locales. Be careful, when

  /// ## Design discussion

  /// ### Why is the default value of [gaplessPlayback] false?
  ///
  /// Having the default value of [gaplessPlayback] be false helps prevent
  /// situations where stale or misleading information might be presented.
  /// Consider the following case:
  ///
  /// We have constructed a 'Person' widget that displays an avatar [Image] of
  /// the currently loaded person along with their name. We could request for a
  /// new person to be loaded into the widget at any time. Suppose we have a
  /// person currently loaded and the widget loads a new person. What happens
  /// if the [Image] fails to load?
  ///
  /// * Option A ([gaplessPlayback] = false): The new person's name is coupled
  /// with a blank image.
  ///
  /// * Option B ([gaplessPlayback] = true): The widget displays the avatar of
  /// the previous person and the name of the newly loaded person.
  ///
  /// This is why the default value is false. Most of the time, when you change
  /// the image provider you're not just changing the image, you're removing the
  /// old widget and adding a new one and not expecting them to have any
  /// relationship. With [gaplessPlayback] on you might accidentally break this
  /// expectation and re-use the old widget.

  /// Used to provide a description of the image to TalkBack on Android, and
  /// VoiceOver on iOS.
  final String? semanticLabel;

  /// Whether to exclude this image from semantics.

  /// Useful for images which do not contribute meaningful information to an
  /// application.
